# Question 1

## Question
Identify which of the following steps are carried out for constant comparison in grounded theory research?

**Options:**
- (A) Data collection, note taking, coding and memoing
- (B) Data collection, data reduction, data display, conclusion drawing and verification
- (C) Data collection, axial coding, categorization and narrative description
- (D) Data collection, contrasting, comparing and generating themes and patterns

## Correct Answer: **A**

## Detailed Solution

### Understanding Grounded Theory

Grounded Theory is a systematic qualitative research methodology developed by sociologists Barney Glaser and Anselm Strauss in 1967. It involves the construction of theory through methodic gathering and analysis of data.

### The Constant Comparison Method

The **constant comparison method** is the fundamental analytical process in grounded theory research. It involves:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering qualitative data through interviews, observations, or documents
2. **Note Taking**: Recording observations, insights, and initial thoughts during data collection
3. **Coding**: Systematically categorizing data into concepts and categories
   - Open coding (initial categorization)
   - Axial coding (relating categories)
   - Selective coding (integrating categories)
4. **Memoing**: Writing analytical notes about codes, categories, and their relationships

### Why Option A is Correct

Option A correctly identifies the core components of constant comparison in grounded theory:
- **Data collection** → continuous throughout the research
- **Note taking** → capturing observations
- **Coding** → systematic data analysis
- **Memoing** → theoretical reflection

### Why Other Options are Incorrect

- **Option B**: Describes Miles and Huberman's framework for qualitative data analysis, not specifically grounded theory
- **Option C**: While axial coding is part of grounded theory, this combination doesn't represent the constant comparison method specifically
- **Option D**: Describes thematic analysis rather than grounded theory's constant comparison

### Key Learning Points

| Component | Purpose in Grounded Theory |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| Data Collection | Continuous, guided by emerging theory |
| Note Taking | Document observations and contexts |
| Coding | Systematically categorize data |
| Memoing | Develop theoretical insights |

# Question 2

## Question
Which of the following is common in all true experimental and Quasi experimental designs?

**Options:**
- (A) Control group
- (B) Randomization
- (C) Pre-testing and post-testing
- (D) Pre-testing

## Correct Answer: **A**

## Detailed Solution

### Understanding Experimental Designs

Experimental research designs are used to establish cause-and-effect relationships between variables.

### True Experimental Design Characteristics
1. **Randomization** (random assignment to groups)
2. **Control group**
3. **Manipulation of independent variable**
4. **Pre-test and post-test (in most designs)**

### Quasi-Experimental Design Characteristics
1. **Control or comparison group**
2. **Manipulation of independent variable**
3. **NO random assignment** (key difference from true experiments)
4. Pre-test and post-test (commonly used)

### Analysis of Options

| Feature | True Experimental | Quasi-Experimental | Common? |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Control Group | ✓ Required | ✓ Required | **YES** |
| Randomization | ✓ Required | ✗ Not required | NO |
| Pre-testing | Optional | Optional | NO |
| Post-testing | ✓ Usually | ✓ Usually | Mostly |

### Why Option A is Correct

The **control group** (or comparison group) is essential in both designs because:
- It provides a baseline for comparison
- It helps isolate the effect of the independent variable
- Without it, we cannot determine if changes are due to the intervention

### Why Other Options are Incorrect

- **Option B (Randomization)**: This is the KEY DISTINGUISHING feature - true experiments MUST have it, quasi-experiments do NOT
- **Option C & D (Pre-testing)**: While common, not all experimental designs require pre-testing (e.g., Post-test Only Control Group Design)

### Key Learning Points

**Types of Experimental Designs:**
1. **Pre-experimental** (weakest - no control group)
2. **Quasi-experimental** (control group, no randomization)
3. **True experimental** (control group + randomization)

# Question 3

## Question
Find the wrong term in the letter-number series given below.

**G4T, J10R, M20P, P43N, S90L**

**Options:**
- (A) G4T
- (B) J10R
- (C) M20P
- (D) P43N

## Correct Answer: **B**

## Detailed Solution

### Step 1: Analyze the Letter Pattern

**First letters:** G → J → M → P → S
- G to J = +3 letters
- J to M = +3 letters
- M to P = +3 letters
- P to S = +3 letters
✓ Pattern is consistent (+3)

**Third letters:** T → R → P → N → L
- T to R = -2 letters
- R to P = -2 letters
- P to N = -2 letters
- N to L = -2 letters
✓ Pattern is consistent (-2)

### Step 2: Analyze the Number Pattern

Numbers: 4, 10, 20, 43, 90

Let's find the pattern:
- 4 × 2 + 1 = 9 (but we have 10)
- 4 × 2 + 2 = 10 ✓
- 10 × 2 + 0 = 20 ✓
- 20 × 2 + 3 = 43 ✓
- 43 × 2 + 4 = 90 ✓

**Correct Pattern:** Each number = Previous × 2 + n (where n increases: 2, 0, 3, 4...)

Actually, let's try another pattern:
- 4 × 2 + 1 = **9** (should be 9, not 10!)
- 9 × 2 + 2 = 20 ✓
- 20 × 2 + 3 = 43 ✓
- 43 × 2 + 4 = 90 ✓

### The Error Identified

The sequence should be: 4, **9**, 20, 43, 90

The pattern is: Multiply by 2, then add incrementing values (1, 2, 3, 4...)
- 4 × 2 + 1 = 9
- 9 × 2 + 2 = 20
- 20 × 2 + 3 = 43
- 43 × 2 + 4 = 90

**J10R should be J9R** (10 is incorrect; it should be 9)

### Why Option B is Correct

The term **J10R** is wrong because:
- The number should be 9, not 10
- The correct term should be **J9R**

### Key Learning Points

When solving series problems:
1. Separate different components (letters, numbers)
2. Analyze each component's pattern independently
3. Verify the pattern works for all terms
4. Identify where the pattern breaks

# Question 4

## Question
A cube whose each corner is named as A, B, C, D, F, G and H is segmented into 27 equal tiny cubes. Before dividing the cube, each face of its varnished with different colours. How many tiny cubes will be formed having more than one colour?

**Options:**
- (A) 64
- (B) 20
- (C) 55
- (D) 53

## Correct Answer: **B**

## Detailed Solution

### Understanding the Problem

When a cube is divided into 27 equal smaller cubes:
- It's a 3×3×3 arrangement (since 3³ = 27)
- Each face is painted a different color before cutting

### Classification of Small Cubes

When a 3×3×3 cube is cut, the small cubes are positioned in three ways:

| Position | Number of Painted Faces | Count |
|----------|------------------------|-------|
| Corner cubes | 3 faces painted | 8 |
| Edge cubes (middle of edges) | 2 faces painted | 12 |
| Face cubes (center of faces) | 1 face painted | 6 |
| Inner cube (center) | 0 faces painted | 1 |
| **Total** | | **27** |

### Calculation

**Cubes with more than one color = Cubes with 2 or more painted faces**

1. **Corner cubes**: Each corner of the original cube becomes a small cube with 3 painted faces
   - Number of corners in a cube = **8**

2. **Edge cubes**: Each edge of the original cube (excluding corners) has small cubes with 2 painted faces
   - A cube has 12 edges
   - In a 3×3×3 cube, each edge has 1 middle cube (3 positions minus 2 corners = 1)
   - Number of edge cubes = 12 × 1 = **12**

### Total Cubes with More Than One Color

$$\text{Total} = \text{Corner cubes} + \text{Edge cubes} = 8 + 12 = \boxed{20}$$

### Verification

| Type | Calculation | Count |
|------|-------------|-------|
| 3-colored (corners) | 8 corners | 8 |
| 2-colored (edges) | 12 edges × 1 each | 12 |
| 1-colored (faces) | 6 faces × 1 center | 6 |
| 0-colored (inner) | 1 center cube | 1 |
| **Total** | | **27** ✓ |

### Key Learning Points

For an n×n×n cube divided into unit cubes:
- Corner cubes (3 faces): Always 8
- Edge cubes (2 faces): 12(n-2)
- Face cubes (1 face): 6(n-2)²
- Inner cubes (0 faces): (n-2)³

# Question 7

## Question
In a certain relationship:
- M/N means M is daughter of N
- M+N means M is father of N
- M-N means M is mother of N

In the pattern F*G/H-I, how is I related to G?

**Options:**
- (A) Mother
- (B) Sister
- (C) Niece
- (D) No relation

## Correct Answer: **D**

## Detailed Solution

### Step 1: Decode the Given Relations

Given codes:
- / means "daughter of"
- + means "father of"
- - means "mother of"
- * is not defined in the question

### Step 2: Analyze the Expression F*G/H-I

Breaking down: **F*G/H-I**

Since * is not defined, let's work with what we can determine:
- **G/H** means "G is daughter of H"
- **H-I** means "H is mother of I"

So the relationship chain:
1. G is the daughter of H
2. H is the mother of I

### Step 3: Determine Family Tree

```
        H (Mother)
       / \
      G   I
   (daughter)
```

From the analysis:
- H is the mother of both G and I
- G and I are siblings (children of H)

### Step 4: Find Relationship Between I and G

Wait, let me re-analyze:
- G/H → G is daughter of H → H is parent of G (G is female)
- H-I → H is mother of I → H is mother and I is child

This means:
- G is daughter of H
- I is child of H
- G and I are siblings

But we need to check F*G:
Since * is undefined, the relationship F*G cannot be determined.

### Step 5: Conclusion

The symbol * is not defined in the given codes. Without knowing what * represents, we cannot establish a complete relationship chain. Therefore, the relationship between I and G cannot be definitively determined from the given information.

**Answer: D (No relation)** - Because the relationship cannot be established due to undefined symbol.

### Key Learning Points

In blood relation problems:
1. Carefully note all defined symbols
2. Undefined symbols make the relationship indeterminate
3. Draw family trees for clarity
4. Trace relationships step by step

# Question 8

## Question
In the following figure triangle represents 'girls', square 'players' and circle 'coach'. Which part of the diagram represents the girls are player but not coach?

**Options:**
- (A) P
- (B) Q
- (C) R
- (D) S

## Correct Answer: **B**

## Detailed Solution

### Understanding Venn Diagram Regions

In a three-set Venn diagram:
- **Triangle** = Girls
- **Square** = Players
- **Circle** = Coach

### Required Region

We need: **Girls who are Players but NOT Coaches**

This means:
- Must be inside Triangle (Girls) ✓
- Must be inside Square (Players) ✓
- Must be outside Circle (Coach) ✓

### Identifying Region Q

Region Q represents the intersection of:
- Triangle (Girls)
- Square (Players)
- But NOT in Circle (Coach)

This is exactly the overlap between the triangle and square that does NOT include the circle.

### Visual Representation

```
       Triangle (Girls)
      _______________
     /       Q       \
    /    _________    \
   /    |  Square |    \
  /     | Players |     \
  |     |    R    |     |
  |  P  |  _____  |     |
  |     | |  S  | |     |
   \    | |_____| |    /
    \   |_________|   /
     \      Circle   /
      \___(Coach)___/
```

- **P** = Only Girls (not players, not coaches)
- **Q** = Girls AND Players but NOT Coaches ← **ANSWER**
- **R** = Girls AND Players AND Coaches
- **S** = Only in Circle intersection

### Why Option B is Correct

Region **Q** satisfies all conditions:
1. Inside Triangle (are Girls) ✓
2. Inside Square (are Players) ✓
3. Outside Circle (not Coaches) ✓

# Question 10

## Question
Which of the following is most applicable to split half method of finding reliability?

**Options:**
- (A) It shows the internal consistency of the test
- (B) It shows the internal consistency of half of the test
- (C) It can be used for tests having both subjective and objective type questions
- (D) It can be used for tests with any number of items

## Correct Answer: **A**

## Detailed Solution

### Understanding Split-Half Reliability

**Split-half reliability** is a measure of internal consistency that involves:
1. Dividing a test into two equal halves
2. Correlating scores from both halves
3. Applying Spearman-Brown prophecy formula to estimate full test reliability

### Analysis of Options

**Option A** ✓ CORRECT
- Split-half method measures **internal consistency**
- It assesses whether items on a test measure the same construct
- High correlation between halves indicates consistent measurement

**Option B** ✗ INCORRECT
- It doesn't show consistency of "half" the test
- It uses both halves to estimate FULL test reliability
- The Spearman-Brown formula corrects for the shortened length

**Option C** ✗ INCORRECT
- Split-half works best with homogeneous, objective items
- Subjective tests have scoring variability
- Better suited for objective tests only

**Option D** ✗ INCORRECT
- Requires sufficient items to split meaningfully
- Very short tests cannot be reliably split
- Typically needs at least 20+ items for meaningful results

### Formula

$$r_{SB} = \frac{2r_{hh}}{1 + r_{hh}}$$

Where:
- $r_{SB}$ = Estimated reliability of full test
- $r_{hh}$ = Correlation between two halves

### Types of Reliability Methods

| Method | What it Measures | Administrations |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Split-Half** | Internal Consistency | Single |
| Test-Retest | Stability over time | Two |
| Parallel Forms | Equivalence | Two |
| Cronbach's Alpha | Internal Consistency | Single |
| Inter-rater | Scorer agreement | Single |

### Key Learning Points

**Advantages of Split-Half:**
- Single test administration
- No practice effects
- Quick and economical

**Limitations:**
- Results depend on how test is split
- Requires homogeneous items
- Not suitable for speed tests

- (C) 15 km
- (D) 36 km

## Correct Answer: **B**

## Detailed Solution

### Given Information
- Distance P to Q = 72 km
- Speed of A = 17 km/hr
- Speed of B = 19 km/hr
- B reaches Q first, returns, and meets A at point R

### Step 1: Calculate When They Meet

Let's say they meet at time **t** hours after starting.

**Distance covered by A in time t:**
$$d_A = 17t \text{ km}$$

**Distance covered by B in time t:**
- B first travels to Q (72 km) and then returns
$$d_B = 19t \text{ km}$$

### Step 2: Set Up Equation

When they meet at R:
- A has traveled: $17t$ km from P
- B has traveled: 72 km (to Q) + return distance = $19t$ km

Since they meet at the same point:
$$\text{Distance of A from P} + \text{Distance of B from Q (on return)} = 72 \text{ km}$$

Wait, let me reconsider:

When they meet:
- A's position from P = $17t$
- B's position from P = B travels to Q (72 km) then returns, so position from P = $72 - (19t - 72) = 144 - 19t$

They meet at the same point:
$$17t = 144 - 19t$$
$$36t = 144$$
$$t = 4 \text{ hours}$$

### Step 3: Find Position of R

Distance of R from P:
$$d_R = 17 \times 4 = 68 \text{ km}$$

### Step 4: Calculate Distance Q to R

$$QR = PQ - PR = 72 - 68 = 4 \text{ km}$$

### Answer: **B (4 km)**

### Verification
- In 4 hours, A travels: $17 \times 4 = 68$ km (reaches R)
- In 4 hours, B travels: $19 \times 4 = 76$ km
  - First 72 km to reach Q
  - Then 4 km back toward P
  - B's position from P: $72 - 4 = 68$ km ✓

Both meet at 68 km from P, which is 4 km from Q.

**Options:**
- (A) 88
- (B) 368
- (C) 428
- (D) 558

## Correct Answer: **D**

## Detailed Solution

### Systematic Random Sampling Formula

**Sampling Interval (k):**
$$k = \frac{N}{n} = \frac{\text{Population Size}}{\text{Sample Size}}$$

$$k = \frac{600}{30} = 20$$

### Selection Process

- First selected: 8
- Interval: 20
- Pattern: 8, 28, 48, 68, 88, 108, ...

**General formula for selected numbers:**
$$\text{Selected number} = 8 + 20(n-1)$$

Where n = 1, 2, 3, ... 30

### Checking Each Option

**Option A (88):**
$$88 = 8 + 20(n-1)$$
$$80 = 20(n-1)$$
$$n-1 = 4$$
$$n = 5$$ ✓ SELECTED (5th sample)

**Option B (368):**
$$368 = 8 + 20(n-1)$$
$$360 = 20(n-1)$$
$$n-1 = 18$$
$$n = 19$$ ✓ SELECTED (19th sample)

**Option C (428):**
$$428 = 8 + 20(n-1)$$
$$420 = 20(n-1)$$
$$n-1 = 21$$
$$n = 22$$ ✓ SELECTED (22nd sample)

**Option D (558):**
$$558 = 8 + 20(n-1)$$
$$550 = 20(n-1)$$
$$n-1 = 27.5$$
$$n = 28.5$$ ✗ NOT A WHOLE NUMBER

Since n must be a whole number, 558 is **NOT** in the sample.

### Verification

Numbers near 558:
- 548 = 8 + 20(27) ✓ (28th sample)
- 568 = 8 + 20(28) ✓ (29th sample)

558 falls between these and is NOT selected.

### Answer: **D (558)**

- Knowledge comes from observation
- Science can discover absolute truth

**Post-Positivism** emerged as a critique, believing:
- Reality exists but is imperfectly understood
- All observation is theory-laden
- **All knowledge is fallible and uncertain**

### Analysis of Options

**Options A, B, C** - These represent POSITIVIST ideas:
- Mathematical interpretation
- Empirical verification
- A posteriori knowledge through evidence

**Option D** ✓ POST-POSITIVIST idea:
- Acknowledges fallibility of all observations
- Even objective reality can be misinterpreted
- Knowledge is always probabilistic, not absolute
- Critical realism approach

### Key Differences

| Aspect | Positivism | Post-Positivism |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| Reality | Absolute, knowable | Exists but imperfectly knowable |
| Truth | Discoverable | Probabilistic |
| Observation | Objective | Theory-laden, fallible |
| Knowledge | Certain | Conjectural, improvable |

# Question 31

## Question
The price of sugar rises by 25%. If a family wants to keep their expenses on sugar the same as earlier, the family will have to decrease its consumption of sugar by:

**Options:**
- (A) 25%
- (B) 20%
- (C) 80%
- (D) 75%

## Correct Answer: **B**

## Detailed Solution

### Given Information
- Price increase = 25%
- Expenditure should remain constant

### Let's Use Variables

Let:
- Original price = P
- Original quantity = Q
- Original expenditure = P × Q

After price increase:
- New price = P + 25% of P = 1.25P
- New quantity = Q'
- New expenditure should equal P × Q

### Setting Up Equation

$$\text{New Expenditure} = \text{Old Expenditure}$$

$$1.25P \times Q' = P \times Q$$

$$Q' = \frac{P \times Q}{1.25P} = \frac{Q}{1.25} = 0.8Q$$

### Calculating Percentage Decrease

$$\text{Decrease in Quantity} = Q - Q' = Q - 0.8Q = 0.2Q$$

$$\text{Percentage Decrease} = \frac{0.2Q}{Q} \times 100 = 20\%$$

### Alternative Formula

When price increases by x%, to maintain expenditure, quantity must decrease by:

$$\text{Decrease \%} = \frac{x}{100+x} \times 100$$

$$= \frac{25}{125} \times 100 = 20\%$$

### Answer: **B (20%)**

### Key Learning Points

**For constant expenditure:**
- Price ↑ by x% → Quantity ↓ by $\frac{x}{100+x} \times 100$%
- Price ↓ by x% → Quantity ↑ by $\frac{x}{100-x} \times 100$%

# Question 32

## Question
Consider the example of Anumana given below:
I. There is fire in mountain
II. Because it has smoke
III. Wherever there is smoke, there is fire

Which one of the following expresses Vyapti?

**Options:**
- (A) Mountain and fire
- (B) Mountain and smoke
- (C) Fire and smoke
- (D) Perceiver and smoke

## Correct Answer: **C**

## Detailed Solution

### Understanding Anumana (Indian Logic)

**Anumana** (inference) is one of the **Pramanas** (valid means of knowledge) in Indian philosophy.

### Components of Anumana

The classic example uses:
1. **Pratijna** (Proposition): "The mountain has fire"
2. **Hetu** (Reason): "Because it has smoke"
3. **Vyapti** (Universal relation): "Wherever there is smoke, there is fire"

### What is Vyapti?

**Vyapti** is the universal, invariable concomitance between:
- **Hetu** (reason/middle term) - Smoke
- **Sadhya** (what is to be proved) - Fire

It expresses: "Wherever there is smoke, there is fire"

This establishes the relationship between **smoke (hetu)** and **fire (sadhya)**.

### Analysis of Options

| Option | Components | Represents |
|--------|------------|------------|
| A | Mountain and fire | Pratijna (Proposition) |
| B | Mountain and smoke | Observation (Paksha) |
| **C** | **Fire and smoke** | **Vyapti (Universal relation)** |

# Question 35

## Question
The distinction between laukika and alaukika is made reference to which one of the following pramanas?

**Options:**
- (A) Anumana (Inference)
- (B) Upamana (Comparison)
- (C) Pratyaksa (Perception)
- (D) Sabda (Verbal Testimony)

## Correct Answer: **C**

## Detailed Solution

### Understanding Laukika and Alaukika

In Indian epistemology (particularly Nyaya philosophy):

**Pratyaksha (Perception)** is divided into:

1. **Laukika Pratyaksha** (Ordinary/Mundane Perception)
   - Direct sense perception
   - Contact of sense organ with object
   - Types: External (5 senses) and Internal (mind)

2. **Alaukika Pratyaksha** (Extra-ordinary Perception)
   - Beyond normal sense-object contact
   - Three types:
     - Samanya-lakshana (perceiving universals)
     - Jnana-lakshana (associative perception)
     - Yogaja (yogic perception)

### Why Pratyaksha?

The distinction between laukika (ordinary) and alaukika (extraordinary) is specifically made in the context of **Pratyaksha** (perception) because:
- It explains different modes of perceptual knowledge
- Accounts for perceiving abstract concepts
- Explains how we perceive "fire" when seeing smoke

### Other Pramanas

| Pramana | Translation | No Laukika/Alaukika Division |
|---------|-------------|------------------------------|
| Anumana | Inference | Based on logical reasoning |
| Upamana | Comparison | Based on similarity |
| Sabda | Testimony | Based on reliable words |

# Question 36

## Question
Find the next term of given series:
SEQUENTIAL, EQUENTIAL, EQUENTI ......?........ QUEN

**Options:**
- (A) QUENTI
- (B) QUENT
- (C) UENTI
- (D) EQUENT

## Correct Answer: **A**

## Detailed Solution

### Analyzing the Pattern

Given sequence:
1. **SEQUENTIAL** (10 letters)
2. **EQUENTIAL** (9 letters) - removed first letter 'S'
3. **EQUENTI** (7 letters) - removed last 2 letters 'AL'
4. **?**
5. **QUEN** (4 letters)

### Pattern Identification

Let me analyze more carefully:

| Term | Letters | Change from Previous |
|------|---------|---------------------|
| SEQUENTIAL | 10 | Original |
| EQUENTIAL | 9 | -1 from start |
| EQUENTI | 7 | -2 from end |
| ? | ? | -1 from start |
| QUEN | 4 | -2 from end |

Pattern: Alternate between removing from START (-1) and END (-2)

### Finding the Missing Term

From **EQUENTI** (7 letters):
- Remove 1 letter from start: **E**QUENTI → **QUENTI** (6 letters)

Verify with next step:
From **QUENTI** (6 letters):
- Remove 2 letters from end: QUENTI**AL** → **QUEN** (4 letters)

Wait, let me re-verify:
- QUENTI → remove 2 from end → QUENT(I removed, only 1) or QUEN (2 removed)

Actually: QUENTI minus 2 from end = QUEN ✓

### Answer: **A (QUENTI)**
