**Question:** In the following if the smallest circle represents candidates clearing GSET exam, bigger circle represents candidates clearing only Paper-I of the GSET exam and the biggest circle represents the candidates who failed in the GSET exam, then choose the diagram which correctly represents this relationships.
**Options:**
(A) [Diagram A]
(B) [Diagram B]
(C) [Diagram C]
(D) [Diagram D]

**Correct Answer:** (C) [Diagram C] 

**Detailed Solution:**
Logic:

1. **Smallest Circle (Cleared GSET):** If you clear GSET, you automatically passed Paper-I. So, this circle should be inside the "Cleared Paper-I" group.
2. **Bigger Circle (Cleared Paper-I):** Includes those who cleared the whole exam AND those who passed Paper-I but failed Paper-II/III.
3. **Biggest Circle (Failed GSET):** People who failed GSET include:
* Those who failed Paper-I (Outside the Paper-I circle).
* Those who passed Paper-I but failed Paper-II/III (Inside Paper-I circle but outside GSET circle).
* Those who cleared GSET (Smallest circle) are NOT in the Failed circle.
* Therefore, the diagrams likely depict specific overlaps. Diagram C typically represents this disjoint/subset relationship correctly in such exams (usually disjoint sets for Pass vs Fail, but overlap for partial pass).
* *Note: Without seeing the visual diagrams, this solution relies on the Answer Key mapping.*

# Question 56

**Question:** Consider the following statement followed by two assumptions (i) and (ii). Choose the correct answer. Statement : "You are hereby appointed as a programmer with a probation period of one year and your performance will be reviewed at the end of the period for confirmation." A line in an appointment letter. Assumptions : (i) The performance of an individual is generally not known at the time of appointment offer. (ii) Generally an individual tries to prove his/her worth in the probation period.
**Options:**
(A) Only Assumption (i) is implicit.
(B) Only Assumption (ii) is implicit.
(C) None of the assumptions (i) and (ii) are implicit.
(D) Both the Assumptions (i) and (ii) are implicit.

**Correct Answer:** (A) Only Assumption (i) is implicit. 

**Detailed Solution:**
The employer sets a probation period because they do not yet fully know the candidate's actual performance (Assumption i). While one hopes the individual tries to prove their worth (ii), the *reason* for the clause is the lack of knowledge about performance. The answer key selects (A).

# Question 57

**Question:** Of the following statements, there are two statements both of which cannot be false but both can be true. Which are these two statements? (i) All the students wish to complete their study. (ii) Some students do not like Mathematics. (iii) No student wishes to complete the study. (iv) No student likes Mathematics.
**Options:**
(A) (i) and (ii)
(B) (iii) and (iv)
(C) (i) and (iii)
(D) (ii) and (iv)

**Correct Answer:** (B) (iii) and (iv) 
*(Note: The question asks for Sub-contraries (can both be true, cannot both be false). Standard logic would point to "Some..." (I) and "Some not..." (O). The provided options and key (B) do not fit the standard square of opposition logic for the given statements, implying a potential error in the question text or key.)*

**Detailed Solution:**
According to the official key, the answer is (B).

# Question 58

**Question:** Evaluate the following statements in terms of whether each is a Fact, Opinion, Prejudice or Advice by choosing correct alternative. (i) Women are not suitable for police service. (ii) In democracy no party should be in power for too long (iii) Have proper rest even during examination time. (iv) Obesity is a risk factor for coronary heart diseases.
**Options:**
(A) (ii) (iii) (iv) (i)
(B) (ii) (i) (iv) (iii)
(C) (iii) (i) (iv) (ii)
(D) (ii) (iv) (iii) (i)

**Correct Answer:** (B) (ii) (i) (iv) (iii) 

**Detailed Solution:**
Match the statements to the categories:

* (i) Women not suitable... -> **Prejudice** (Biased view).
* (ii) No party should be in power... -> **Opinion** (Political view).
* (iii) Have proper rest... -> **Advice** (Suggestion).
* (iv) Obesity is a risk... -> **Fact** (Medical truth).
Sequence: Opinion, Prejudice, Fact, Advice.
Option (B) matches: (ii) Opinion, (i) Prejudice, (iv) Fact, (iii) Advice.

# Question 59

**Question:** The question below is followed by two arguments numbered (i) and (ii). Decide which argument is strong. Question: Should India encourage exports when most things are insufficient for internal use itself? Arguments: (i) Yes. We have to earn foreign exchange to pay at least for our defence and other necessary exports. (ii) No. Even selective encouragement will lead to shortages.
**Options:**
(A) Only Argument (i) is strong.
(B) Only Argument (ii) is strong.
(C) Both the Arguments (i) and (ii) are strong.
(D) None of the arguments (i) and (ii) are strong.

**Correct Answer:** (C) Both the Arguments (i) and (ii) are strong. 
*(Note: Often in these exams, earning Forex (i) is considered strong. The Key indicates that preventing shortages (ii) is also a strong, valid concern, making (C) the correct choice.)*

**Detailed Solution:**
Argument (i) is strong because foreign exchange is vital for essential imports (oil, defense). Argument (ii) is also strong because ignoring domestic shortages can lead to inflation and social distress. Thus, both are valid, strong arguments.

# Question 60

**Question:** Consider the following two statements and choose the correct answer. Statement (i): There has been a high increase in the incidents of atrocities against women in the country during past few years. Statement (ii) : The police authority has been unable to nab the culprits committing crime against women.
**Options:**
(A) Statement (i) is cause and Statement (ii) is effect.
(B) Statement (ii) is cause and Statement (i) is effect.
(C) Statements (i) and (ii) are both independent of causes.
(D) Statements (i) and (ii) are both effects of some independent causes.

**Correct Answer:** (C) Statements (i) and (ii) are both independent of causes. 
*(Note: The key selects (C). It could be argued that police inaction causes crime (B), but the key likely views them as separate issues: Rising crime due to social factors, and Police failure due to systemic issues.)*

**Detailed Solution:**
According to the official key, these are treated as **independent of causes** (or effects of independent causes, though the key points to C). This implies that the rise in atrocities and the police's inability to catch culprits are distinct phenomena not necessarily in a direct cause-effect relationship (e.g., crime might rise even with good policing due to other social factors).
